### **Ashes of Guilt**

The morning began in tension and grief. **Alan** awoke to find himself struck by **Sir John**, the blow snapping him from a restless sleep. Alan still carried the weight of tragedy — the accidental death of **Benedict Elric**, his comrade and friend. The rest of the party felt the silence that followed like smoke in the air, a heaviness none dared name aloud.

### **The Scent of Fire and Fate**

Later that day, Maximus awoke to an unfamiliar smell — **smoke and roasting meat** — drifting through the morning air. The scent drew him to **The Roaring Flask**, where the tavern’s kitchen gleamed with spotless perfection. Yet, the smell persisted, stronger inside than out.

There, he found its source: a **gnome with mustard-yellow skin, red hair, and armor of obsidian**. The gnome claimed that Maximus had been **“marked”** and that his path led to the **Ember Spire** — once a temple to the **Flame of the Eternal Grill**, now a blackened ruin of volcanic glass and whispered curses.

### **Deals and Deceits in Norke**

Seeking supplies the group scattered through the forges and markets of **Norke**.

At **Ember & Alloy**, **Sir John** worked his charm and pride to convince the shopkeeper to part with a **metal sling and bullets**, a curious weapon rumored to predate modern arms.

Across town, **Nyxa** tried her luck at **The Iron Pledge**, angling for the same weapon. Her persuasion failed, and tempers flared — an argument sparked between **Liora**, Nyxa, and the shopkeeper that left the atmosphere as hot as any forge.

Meanwhile, **Maximus** turned mischief into profit. At **Mosslight Hollow**, he tricked a merchant into eating a spoonful of mustard he believed was his favorite “dirt,” securing a **bundle of potions for only 100 gold pieces**.

### **A New Dawn, A New Ally**

As evening fell, the party gathered at the steps of the **Ember Spire** — drawn by fate, guilt, and curiosity alike. There, under the crimson light of sunset, they met **Lucien Constantine**, a 6’4” elf paladin called by **Elias** to meet them. Clad in faith and steel, Lucien feared no battle and no venture.

He joined their ranks as the day ended — a new flame kindled in the shadow of loss, marking the close of one chapter and the uncertain beginning of another.
