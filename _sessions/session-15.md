### **Setting**

The party arrives in the radiant, pre-war Spire—alive, holy, and untouched by corruption. The sky burns amber with distant conflict.  
At the forge stand the three founders of the Gatewatch:

- **Serion Vale** — forging a blade of molten light
    
- **Theleth** — steel-and-gold sentinel, wounded but resolute
    
- **Nyss** — horned trickster lounging on crates, amused and dangerous
    

This is the moment before everything falls apart.

# ⭐ **Opening Interaction**

The founders greet the party with curiosity—not fear.  
They assume the party has been summoned as new allies.

**Serion** welcomes them with fiery confidence.  
**Theleth** offers calm warnings.  
**Nyss** teases, tests, and probes their motives.

This scene forces **roleplay engagement**—each founder challenges the party in a different ideological direction.

# ⭐ **Founder Challenges**

### 🔱 **Serion Vale — Conviction**

- Tests **purpose** and **heart**
    
- Demands sincerity, rejecting false bravado
    
- Genuine answers spark brief flashes of the party’s forgotten past
    

### ⚙️ **Theleth — Discipline**

- Moral dilemmas about restraint and responsibility
    
- Offers a broken chain to “test” with magic
    
- Fixing or aligning it reveals a memory of Theleth once binding catastrophic power
    

### 😈 **Nyss — Wit & Freedom**

- Tempts, mocks, and challenges the party’s identity
    
- Presents an illusion puzzle (spot the real Nyss)
    
- Clever magic earns her respect and a token reward

# ⭐ **Group Revelation**

Once all three founders have judged the party, Serion brings everyone together:

- Conviction (Serion)
    
- Control (Theleth)
    
- Chaos (Nyss)
    

These forces together forge the **Gatewatch**—the order meant to seal the Rift.

The founders believe the party has arrived to help ignite that creation.

# ⭐ **Temporal Collapse**

A tear in time rips through the forge:

- A shadow-version of Serion whispers fatal truths
    
- Nyss’s form elongates and distorts
    
- Theleth’s internal light cracks
    
- Time freezes, decays, warps
    

The party must stabilize the Spire using spells or creative actions.

Succeeding grants a brief moment of clarity:

**Serion recognizes them from across time.**

He gives final instructions:

> “Find the cores. Light the way back.”

Everything explodes into white heat.
