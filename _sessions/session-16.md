### **Lighting the Grill**

Descending into the depths beneath the **Ember Spire**, the party found themselves surrounded by the smell of smoke, oil, and roasting meat. Following the strange scent, **Maximus** discovered an ancient **grill** in a ruined kitchen — a remnant of the temple’s former purpose. Attempting to ignite it, Maximus unleashed a **forceful fire spell** that blasted both him and **Sir John** into the air, scorching them with their own recklessness. Undeterred, Maximus conjured **a second grill atop the first**, opening a shimmering passage to the next chamber.

### **Temptations of the Senses**

As they entered the new room, the **aroma of food** filled the air, thick and intoxicating. Each member of the party felt their desires tug at their mind:

- **Lucien, Sir John, and Jobin**, sharp of wit and will, saw through the illusion immediately.
    
- **Liora** fell for a bin of “cotton candy,” stuffing her pockets greedily — until Lucien pulled her free, revealing she had been hoarding **shards of broken glass**.
    
- **Alan** discovered a “juicy steak” and attempted to put it in his butt, in a bizarre fit of enchantment, nearly hid it upon his person before realizing it was a **rotting hotdog**.
    
- **Maximus** found himself embracing the **most beautiful hotdog imaginable** — only to awaken to **a spiked bottle of ketchup** in his arms, thanks to Sir John’s intervention.
    
- **Nyxa** devoured a **sweet roll**, which turned out to be a **doughnut full of nails** before Lucien tackled her away from it.
    

Once the spell was broken, the illusion faded, leaving only laughter, confusion, and the acrid smell of burnt sugar.

### **The Mephit Chef’s Fury**

The next room sizzled with heat. A **Magma Mephit Chef**, wreathed in flame and fury, awaited them. With mocking laughter, he conjured **lava pits** and rained fire upon the adventurers, assaulting both their bodies and minds.

Through grit and pain, **Maximus** delivered the finishing blow — a roaring **Mustard Blast** that tore a hole straight through the chef’s chest, ricocheted off the wall, and sliced off the Mephit’s left toe. The fiery creature collapsed into molten ash, the smell of charred meat thick in the air.

### **The Feast of the Dead**

The party entered a dim hall lined with **ghostly diners** seated at a long table. A **skeletal waiter** approached and presented Maximus with a grim challenge: he must **serve a four-course meal** to appease the spirits — each dish representing a sacrifice.

The ghosts demanded:

1. **Something he loved**
    
2. **Something warm**
    
3. **Something that could not be remade**
    
4. **The party’s greatest failure**
    

Maximus offered:

- A **spoonful of cayenne pepper**, symbol of his victories,
    
- **Chorizo Dan’s toe**, a relic of past battles,
    
- The **warmth of his grill**,

- And the party each confessed their **greatest regrets** to complete the offering.
    

Satisfied, the ghosts granted them a **divine meal**, restoring their health and easing their wounds. As they faded, a deep voice echoed through the chamber — a voice that asked Maximus, _“Are you willing to burn for your belief?”_

### **The Grillmaster Eternal**

In the final chamber, the party stood before the **Grillmaster Eternal**, the god of flame and flavor himself. His fury was immediate — the floor split with **lava pools**, scorching the party. Yet when his anger cooled, he offered them a final test:

Each hero was to **create something only they could offer**.

- **Alan** grew to a massive size, earning only the Grillmaster’s laughter.
    
- **Sir John** unleashed a dazzling **Eldritch Blast**, unimpressive to divine eyes.
    
- **Maximus** crafted the **greatest hotdog ever tasted**,
    
- **Nyxa**, invisible and cunning, **stole one from his hand**, earning the god’s amusement.
    
- **Lucien** wove vines into a **divine hotdog**, which even the Grillmaster praised.
    

Then came the final command — a **sacrifice**. One must step into the **divine flame** to save the rest.

Maximus, ever the believer, stepped forward. Flames consumed him. He screamed, staggered back, then in anger conjured a **mustard blast** — but realizing the futility, **he drank the mustard instead**.

When the god asked again, Maximus entered the fire a second time — and **died before their eyes**. Yet the Grillmaster, pleased by his devotion, restored his life and granted him the **Ever-Burning Buns**, a divine blessing that would never cool.

### **Echoes of the Past**

Leaving the Ember Spire, the world outside **shifted and warped**. Rain poured like **liquid metal**, and the earth trembled. **Alan’s pack** began to rumble — inside, the **cracked memory core** spilled forth **purple temporal smoke**, distorting time itself.

As the haze spread, the party’s bodies **shifted to their younger forms**, hands strong and bloodstained from the war. **Sir John** looked around and realized, with growing dread, that **everyone had returned to the age they were during the war** — everyone except **Jobin**.
