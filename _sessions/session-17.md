The party finally grasped the truth: they had been **pulled into the past**, decades before their own time. Only Jobin remained unchanged, while the others found themselves in younger bodies and a version of Norke untouched by decay.

As they navigated old Norke in confusion, they were discovered by a young Flame Eternal priestess named **Elandra Vale**, not much older than they appeared. Elandra instantly sensed the temporal disturbance their presence caused, warning them that they had triggered a divine anomaly known as **the Great Cooling**. In her vague, cryptic manner, she directed them to seek out **the Ash Bearers**, currently performing a ceremony at the base of the great clocktower.

## **⏳ The Call Toward the Clocktower**

On the way, Jobin noticed Liora drifting out of formation, drawn unconsciously toward the northern treeline. She could barely articulate the pull — an instinctive tether more than a choice — and the party eventually herded back together.

At the clocktower ceremony, the High Priestess **Solenne Draeg** immediately froze upon noticing the party. She approached Maximus directly, looking as though she recognized something burning behind his eyes.

> **“The fire remembers you. But it burns… _strangely._ Who has marked you?”**

Confusion from Maximus only deepened her suspicion. She instructed the party to stay where they were while she investigated.

Solenne quickly uncovered the truth: the group carried a **cracked memory core**, and their presence had disrupted the sanctity of this timeline. The only path home, she explained, was to **restore what was broken** and mend any lingering fractures of destiny.

That was when Liora spoke of the pull she felt toward the trees — and Solenne connected it instantly.

To the north was **Emerald Rest**.

Liora’s birthplace.

And the site of her greatest trauma.

Trying to hide the dread twisting inside her, Liora told the others they needed to go.

## **🌲 Return to Emerald Rest**

Emerald Rest stood silent. Deserted. Hollow.

As the others investigated the abandoned homes and overgrown paths, Liora’s composure finally cracked. Shock and anguish rooted her in place. Her fear and buried guilt swelled until it **manifested physically**, warping the fey-touched air.

Two fey forms and a writhing aberration emerged, taunting the group with reflections of Liora’s inner turmoil. The party battled through them, cutting down the emotional projections.

Then the ancient tree at the heart of town **burst open**, revealing a path downward.

## **🌑 Beneath the Roots — Confrontation of the Past**

In the cavern below, the party found the phantoms of Liora’s long-dead parents, their presence reigniting the fury and terror Liora had buried for years. Their appearance cracked something inside her, and from that rupture rose a physical embodiment of her monstrous past:

**Bloodbriar.**

A towering manifestation of wrath, guilt, and wild magic.  
It reshaped the battlefield, fed on hesitation, and lashed out at anything unsure.

The fight was brutal — intimate, emotional, and raw.

But the party prevailed.

When Bloodbriar fell, the altar at the chamber's center reshaped itself into an armor stand, revealing a divine treasure: a **violet briar cloak**, pulsing with Liora’s reclaimed identity and newfound balance.

She accepted the cloak, completing a chapter of her past that had once nearly consumed her.

The session closed with the party bedding down in the quiet ruins of Emerald Rest, the air heavy with memory, but the path forward a little clearer.
