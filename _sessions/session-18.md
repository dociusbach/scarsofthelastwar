The party wakes to a village that should not exist.

Instead of the ruined, empty Emerald Rest they remember, they find **life** returning in impossible detail:  
children laughing, breakfast smells rising, neighbors chatting, and buildings restored exactly as they once were.

But not everything is right.  
Liora’s parents remain absent—yet the townsfolk treat this as perfectly normal.

---

## **A Bookkeeper’s Plea**

A half-elf bookkeeper approaches Liora, bowing repeatedly and calling her:

**“My Leader”**

Liora has no memory of this role.

He reports disturbing phenomena:

- **Silent Choir scouts** appearing around Emerald Rest
    
- Some seen as **double images**, flickering or overlapping
    
- Liora’s **parents** wandering the woods
    

He urges Liora to speak with Norke’s Choir branch leader to understand these distortions.

## **The Descent to the Norke Stronghold**

The party travels to Norke.  
Most struggle to find the secret entrance—except Sir John, who remembers it with irritating confidence.

Inside, they witness:

- Members practicing combat in eerie silence
    
- Strange and anachronistic artifacts scattered throughout
    
- Layers of secrecy woven into every hall
    

They are brought before **Chismarth Keshtai**, leader of the Norke branch. She scrutinizes them:

> **“You move like deserters. Speak quickly: who sent you?”**

When they answer, she mutters:  
**“The core is bleeding again…”**

But when Liora questions her, she snaps:

> **“Enough. Take them to the dungeon.”**

A spell none of them recognize drops them instantly into darkness.

## **The Puzzle Cells**

They awake **separated**, each in a personalized puzzle cell that must be solved to escape.  
Some puzzles require coordination with party members who escape earlier.

The standout moment:  
Sir John, unable to escape, calls upon “Josh” (the DM) in fury, lamenting how much he hates puzzles.

Once they reunite and exit the dungeon, Chismarth waits with a pocket watch:

> **“Right on time. Follow me.”**

She leads them through a labyrinth of shifting hallways to a sealed war room.  
A strange device hums in the corner—something none of the party recognizes.

# **The Three Threats Converging on Hallowmere**

Chismarth explains the truth:

The **memory core of the timeline is leaking**, and the party’s presence in the past has accelerated multiple events not meant to occur today.

These events are converging on **Hallowmere**, not Emerald Rest.

---

## **Threat A — The Empire’s Premature Strike Team**

An Imperial kill-squad has arrived **seven years early** to raze Hallowmere.

Led by:

### **Captain Virellus, the Ember-Wolf**

A future nemesis whom history says _must_ survive today.

**Killing him breaks the future.**

---

## **Threat B — Maskwing, the Misled Choir Operative**

A young tabaxi saboteur—**Maskwing**—believes today _is_ the planned Imperial attack.

Manipulated by the fracture, he intends to:

- Detonate the **Ashen Cipher**
    
- Blame the Empire
    
- Radicalize the Choir into a violent extremist movement
    

If he succeeds, the future Choir becomes something monstrous.

---

## **Threat C — The Moment Wraith**

A temporal predator prowls the edges of Hallowmere:

A **Moment Wraith**, feeding on broken time.

It seeks to:

- Destroy Hallowmere
    
- Consume the Cipher
    
- Expand the timeline fracture
    
- Weaponize fear, illusions, and memories

# **Conclusion**

The party agrees to help stabilize events and prevent catastrophe.

They depart Norke and head toward **Hallowmere**, where all three threats are about to collide.

Their goal:

**Save Hallowmere without breaking the timeline.**
